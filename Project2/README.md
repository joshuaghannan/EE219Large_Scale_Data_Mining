# ECE219 Project 2 - Clustering

## Necessary packages

The python packages required to run this project are given in `requirements.txt`.

## Running the code

In order to use this project, run `Proj2.ipynb` by starting a Jupyter Notebook session and stepping through each block sequentially.

## Notes

Some sections require that previous sections be run before them. Many of the questions have pre-fit data which will automatically be loaded to reduce script runtimes. To re-run all of the K-means clustering results, delete the `\out` directory.
